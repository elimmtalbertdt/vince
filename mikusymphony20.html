<!-- First/Last itteration of Miku Symphony
     - I did not have time nor did I have the know how to make this webpage. This webpage
     when i designed it had the trickest techniques which I don't know how to program and 
     also by the time I finished the rest of my website I did not have enough time to learn
     and code this webpage, so i left it mostly blank. I may do it in the future for my own
     sake but for now I just leave it as it is.
